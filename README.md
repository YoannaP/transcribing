# transcribing

I listen to podcasts on commutes (by bike) and runs. I also write things that have made an impression on me. 

I wanted an easy way to search for what I have heard whilst on the move. 

This project downloads and transcribes audio/video files from different sources: youtube/apple podcasts. 

Scripts:
- `whispr` - uses OpenAI Whispr to transcibe an audio file 
- `download_youtube` - uses pytube to download a video/audio file
- `podcast_download_mp3` - downloads audio files of downloaded apple podcast episodes: # TODO improve this with target podcasts
- `download_youtube` - this downloads the youtube transcipt only (directly from youtube)
